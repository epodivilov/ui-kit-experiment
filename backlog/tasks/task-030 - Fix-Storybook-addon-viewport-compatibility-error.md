## Description

Storybook fails to load with error: @storybook/addon-viewport no longer exists in Storybook 9.0 and above

Fix by:
1. Remove @storybook/addon-viewport from package.json dependencies
2. Remove viewport addon from .storybook/main.ts addons array
3. Update viewport configuration to use Storybook 9.0+ built-in viewport support (viewport is now part of core)
4. Verify Storybook runs without errors

## Implementation Notes

Removed @storybook/addon-viewport from package.json as it's deprecated in Storybook 9.0+. Added @storybook/addon-essentials to .storybook/main.ts which includes viewport functionality by default. Verified Storybook starts without errors.
