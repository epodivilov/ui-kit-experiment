## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Configure package.json exports to expose the generated CSS files to consumers. This allows consumers to import styles using clean paths like 'ui-kit/styles' and 'ui-kit/themes/light' without needing to know the internal dist/ structure. This is a critical step for making the UI Kit consumable without Vanilla-Extract dependencies.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] #1 Export entry added for './styles' pointing to dist/ui-kit.css,Export entry added for './themes/light' pointing to dist/themes/light.css,Export entry added for './themes/dark' pointing to dist/themes/dark.css,All CSS exports include proper file extensions in the paths,Exports are properly configured for both ESM and CommonJS consumers,CSS files can be successfully imported using the defined export paths,package.json is valid and passes validation checks
