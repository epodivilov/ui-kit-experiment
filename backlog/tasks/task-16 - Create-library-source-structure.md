## Description

Create the main library source structure with proper directories for components, themes, utilities, and exports. This establishes the foundation for organizing all UI Kit code in a maintainable way.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 src/components directory created for all UI components,src/themes directory created for theme contracts and providers,src/utils directory created for utility functions,src/types directory created for shared TypeScript types,Main src/index.ts created for library exports,Each directory has proper index.ts files,Directory structure documented in README,Structure supports tree-shaking and selective imports
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Review current src/ directory structure
2. Verify all required directories exist (components, themes, utils, types)
3. Ensure proper index.ts files in each directory
4. Create missing theme/provider structure under src/themes
5. Add proper documentation comments to index files
6. Create src/hooks directory for custom React hooks
7. Update main src/index.ts with proper exports organization
8. Verify tree-shaking friendly export patterns
9. Document directory structure in project README
10. Test that selective imports work correctly
