## Implementation Plan

Currently dark.json theme exists but semantic-dark.css/ts not generating. Investigate:
1. Check if tokens/themes/dark.json has content
2. Check style-dictionary filter for dark theme
3. Verify no collisions with light theme
4. Test dark theme generation
5. Add dark theme to ThemeProvider

Current: Only light theme generates successfully

## Implementation Notes

Dark theme fully implemented in new Token Studio 4-tier architecture with proper light/theme.json and dark/theme.json files.
