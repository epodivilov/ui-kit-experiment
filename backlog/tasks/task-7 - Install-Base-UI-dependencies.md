The package includes all core components (Dialog, Select, Input, Button, Checkbox, etc.) and is fully compatible with React 19 as specified in peer dependencies. Successfully verified both CommonJS and ES module imports work correctly.


## Implementation Notes

Successfully installed Base UI dependencies. Package details: @base-ui-components/react v1.0.0-beta.3. React 19 compatibility confirmed via peer dependencies. All component exports verified (Accordion, AlertDialog, Autocomplete, Avatar, Button, Checkbox, Dialog, Input, Select, etc.). Both require() and import() functionality tested and working. Ready for component development.
