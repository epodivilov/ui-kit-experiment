## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement the Radio component using Base UI as the foundation. The component consists of three parts: Radio Group (to group radio buttons), Radio button (the interactive element), and Radio button Indicator (visual feedback element). The implementation must integrate with the design tokens created in the previous task and use Vanilla-Extract for styling with recipes for prop-to-style mapping. Support label association with Radio button for accessibility.
